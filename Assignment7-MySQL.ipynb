    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. A database is a collection of data that is stored in a way which allows efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of data. It serves as a repository for storing and organizing large volumes of information, making it accessible and usable for various purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) SQL databases are relational databases that store data in structured tables with predefined schemas, making them ideal for structured data with well-defined relationships. (structural database)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) They require a fixed schema, where data structure must be defined before insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) SQL databases use the SQL query language for data management and are typically scaled vertically by adding resources to a single server.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. (unstructured database)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) They allowing changes without predefined schemas, often have flexible or dynamic schemas, . \n",
    "\n",
    "3) They use various query languages tailored to specific data models and are scaled horizontally by adding servers to a distributed cluster.\n",

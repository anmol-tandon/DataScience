    "Improved performance:  Multithreading can help increase the overall performance of an application, especially on systems with multiple processors or cores\n",

    "## Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to the program, making it more difficult to design, implement, and debug. Developers need to be aware of synchronization, deadlocks, race conditions, and other concurrency-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context switching: Context switching between threads consumes CPU time and resources, which can lead to performance degradation if not managed efficiently.\n",
